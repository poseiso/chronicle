          <h3>Lineage: The Shadow of Birch</h3>
          <p>
            Every dragonborn carries the weight of lineage. Anaik carries his like armor,
            deliberately, and heavier than most would choose.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            His ancestor, <strong>Birch</strong>, was a White Dragonborn Barbarian of considerable
            renown, not the kind earned through diplomacy or cunning, but through the
            straightforward and deeply physical act of being impossible to stop.
            Birch understood the world as a series of problems, and problems as a shortage
            of applied muscle. If the door would not open, there was not enough force.
            If the enemy would not fall, there were not enough strikes. If the mountain
            would not yield; Birch had not yet hit it hard enough.
            It was a simple philosophy, and by all accounts, it worked.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            The frost of Birch's white lineage and whatever black-blooded ancestor ran
            further back in the family tree produced, generations later, Anaik, who inherited
            the strength and very little else. The acid breath. The dark scales.
            And a fundamental disagreement with his forefather about what a warrior
            is supposed to be.
          </p>

      <!-- The Iron Creed -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Iron Creed</h3>
        <p>
          Anaik is not modest. He does not lack confidence, nor does he shy away from
          consequence. What he has decided, with a deliberateness that borders on
          philosophical obsession, is that <em>his face is irrelevant to the work.</em>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          Where Birch's legacy was written in scars and spectacle, Anaik's creed is built
          on erasure. He does not need you to know his expression when he charges into
          a line of soldiers. He does not need you to remember his eyes. He needs you,
          if you survive, to remember that something in iron stood in the gap, and held.
          A legend, he believes, is not a man. It is what a man does when no one can see his face.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          To this end, he clads himself in the heaviest plate he can find,
          not for the protection it affords (though it affords quite a lot),
          but because armor is the ultimate argument against personality.
          Beneath it, Anaik could be anyone. Beneath it, it does not matter if he is afraid.
          And as a result of spending so much of his life learning to <em>live</em> inside steel,
          he has become something rarer than either Birch's raw power or a common
          soldier's trained endurance: a master of armament, his body so fluent in the
          language of heavy plate that it no longer slows him; it simply <em>is</em> him.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- The Blood Beneath the Iron -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Blood Beneath the Iron</h3>
        <p>
          He has decided, with considerable deliberateness, to be something different
          from Birch. This is not in question. What is also not in question is that
          Birch's blood is inside him, and it does not always wait for a decision.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The clearest evidence of this is the door. A locked door presents itself.
          Nero moves toward it with his lockpicks, already calculating the mechanism,
          already running through the approach. What he does not know, and discovers
          a moment later, is that Anaik has already started swinging. The door is
          open. The lock has been, by any functional measure, picked. Nero does not
          always find this as resolved as Anaik does.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          This is not a failure of the creed. The iron holds, more often than not.
          Anaik does not swing at everything. He holds the weight of what he is capable
          of with a discipline that would be more visible if the occasions when it
          slips were not so total. But they are there, these moments when Birch
          surfaces through the plate before the philosophy has time to weigh in,
          and something gets handled the direct way, and Anaik has to decide after
          the fact whether he intended that or simply did it.
          The distinction, in outcome, is rarely significant.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- What Moves Him -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>What Moves Him</h3>
        <p>
          He is often the calmest presence in the room. This is accurate and it is also,
          the party has learned, incomplete information. Anaik operates at an even register
          for long stretches, then something trips a wire that is entirely his own and
          entirely non-transferable, and the register changes with no transition and
          no warning visible to outside observers.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The dislike arrives fully formed. He will look at a person, someone the party
          may have just met, someone who has done nothing documentable, and arrive at a
          total conviction. <em>"I hate this guy. Can I kill him with a hammer."</em>
          It is delivered in the same tone as a weather observation. The party has not
          always been able to establish what prompted it. It is possible Anaik has read
          something real that everyone else missed. It is also possible that whatever
          he read is available only to him.
          <em>"This performative ass bitch needs to go. I'm afraid."</em>
          He is not, generally, afraid. This appears to be a figure of speech.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The admiration works the same way: no announcement, no transition, simply the
          full weight of it, directed at something no one else has paused to consider.
          Someone doing their laundry, working through it with the focused attention of
          a person who has decided this task is worth doing properly, will stop Anaik
          entirely. He will watch. He will mean it when he says,
          <em>"Oh, if not for this, what else am I trying to strive for."</em>
          This is not sarcasm. It is, in fact, the most direct window into what
          Anaik actually values: full commitment to whatever you are,
          without performance, without an audience. The laundryman who does it right
          is doing something Anaik considers genuinely aspirational.
          The person who earned his instant dislike has, in all probability,
          done something that registered to him as false.
          Only Anaik holds the criteria.

      <!-- The Anaik-Traxex Problem -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Anaik-Traxex Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Anaik talks about killing people with a frequency that suggests it functions,
          for him, as a form of editorial commentary. A remark about a person in the
          vicinity, something muttered under his breath or stated plainly to no one in
          particular, is more often than not exactly that: a remark. He holds back.
          The iron holds. What he says and what he does are, the majority of the time,
          two separate things, and the party has generally come to understand this.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          Traxex has not always operated on this distinction.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          There have been instances where Anaik made a passing remark about someone nearby,
          and that person subsequently required medical attention, and Traxex was in the area,
          and Anaik had not, in any meaningful sense, issued an instruction. The party has
          noted the pattern. Anaik's response to these incidents appears to involve a
          combination of mild surprise and the slow recognition that the ranger walking
          beside him processes casual commentary as a considerably more operational
          document than he intended. He has not stopped making the remarks.
          Traxex has not started asking for clarification before acting on them.
          The pattern continues.

        <h3>The Question This Chapter Must Answer</h3>
        <p>
          His chapter has only just begun. The iron is chosen. The creed is set.
          But a warrior who hides his being behind steel must eventually reckon with
          what that steel is <em>for</em>, and who, in the end, he is willing to stand
          in front of. Can Anaik protect his companions with the armor he chose
          not for them, but for himself?
          Will the iron that erases his face be the same iron that saves theirs?
