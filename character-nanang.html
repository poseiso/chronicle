          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Nanang is human. This is a fact the party is aware of and has nonetheless
            found difficult to hold onto, because the evidence of it keeps colliding with
            everything else they observe about him. He is the only one among them without
            scales, without infernal blood, without a draconic ancestor or a broken oath
            or the particular restlessness of someone built for something other than ordinary
            life. He is, on paper, the most ordinary member of this company.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            In practice, he is the one they understand least. The intelligence is genuine.
            That much cannot be questioned. There is something operating behind his eyes that
            runs faster and stranger than anything the party has encountered, including the
            things that have tried to kill them. Whether Nanang himself has full access to
            what is operating there is a separate question, with a considerably less
            certain answer.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The Divine Intellect -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Divine Intellect</h3>
        <p>
          There is a particular kind of intelligence that is so far ahead of its surroundings
          that it ceases to look like intelligence at all. Nanang possesses this kind.
          His grasp of the arcane is genuinely vast; he carries more knowledge of spellcraft
          than most scholars accumulate across entire careers, and he reaches for it with
          the casual ease of someone who has never had to search for a word.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The problem is the gap between what he knows and what arrives on the other side
          of the casting. He reaches for the Weave with complete confidence. The Weave,
          for its part, appears to respond with equal confidence. What the party receives
          is the result of both these confidences operating simultaneously, without
          coordination, and without apparent awareness that they might be pointed in
          different directions.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He casts. Something happens. Whether what happens is what he intended is a
          question the party has quietly learned not to ask too directly.
        </p>

      <!-- The Catalog of Incidents -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Catalog of Incidents</h3>
        <p>
          The party has been, at various points and in service of various battles,
          the indirect recipient of Nanang's assistance. The record speaks for itself,
          and so the record is presented here without editorial comment.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He cast a Minor Illusion during combat. The illusion appeared beside his own
          allies rather than his opponents. Three members of the party turned to look
          at it. The enemy did not.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He cast a Fog Cloud with the stated intention of limiting enemy visibility.
          The fog was thorough. It made no apparent distinction between enemy, companion,
          and the various uninvolved bystanders who had the misfortune of being nearby.
          Everyone was equally blinded. This may have been the point. It is unclear.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He cast Grease to neutralize an approaching enemy. The Grease appeared
          beneath Nanang. He fell. The enemy, momentarily confused by this, slowed.
          Whether the outcome was intentional has not been resolved.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1.4rem; padding: 1.2rem 1.5rem; border-left: 3px solid rgba(140, 100, 50, 0.4); background: rgba(210, 172, 108, 0.1);">
          And then there was the crab.<br><br>
          In a moment of direct confrontation with an enemy of considerable power,
          Nanang reached into the Weave and produced a crab. Not a creature of legend.
          Not a conjured horror with fury and teeth. A crab. Placed, with every
          appearance of deliberate intention, directly in front of the enemy.
          The enemy looked at it. The party looked at it. The crab,
          for its part, was a crab.<br><br>
          No one has asked Nanang to explain it. It is possible he cannot.
          It is equally possible that the explanation exists somewhere in the higher
          regions of his intellect, fully formed and entirely coherent,
          and simply has not found a way down yet.
        </p>

      <!-- The Human Who Is Least Human -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Human Who Is Least Human</h3>
        <p>
          Every other member of this party carries something beyond ordinary humanity in
          their blood, their lineage, or their chosen path. Nanang carries only human stock,
          human years, human hands. And yet he is the one the party struggles most to predict.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The tiefling moves like shadow; you learn, in time, to anticipate shadow.
          The dragonborn is an armored wall that hits things; hitting things is
          comprehensible. The ranger creates trouble; trouble, however creative,
          has a shape. Even the oathbreaker's darkness follows a logic you can trace
          if you are willing to sit with it long enough. Nanang does not follow a logic
          that observation can reach. He follows something, certainly. But it runs
          underneath the surface, at a depth where the party's understanding simply
          does not go.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He is more alien to them, in the end, than any of the non-humans among them.
          He is the human they cannot read.
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr class="divider" />

      <!-- The Accidental Tactician -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Accidental Tactician</h3>
        <p>
          Here is the thing about Nanang that the party returns to, reluctantly,
          whenever they consider whether there is a safer place for him than a battlefield:
          if Nanang does not know what he is going to do, neither does the enemy.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          This is not a trivial advantage. Tactics can be read; patterns can be
          anticipated and countered before they arrive. What cannot be anticipated
          is a sorcerer who aimed for a specific target and caught everyone in the room,
          or who reached for frost and produced fog, or who, at the defining moment
          of a critical encounter, introduced a crustacean into the equation.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The chaos is the weapon. Whether Nanang is wielding it intentionally or simply
          expressing it with great consistency is a question without a clean answer.
          But the outcome is the same: in a world where the enemy knows to prepare for
          a tiefling, a dragonborn, a ranger, and an oathbreaker, they are entirely
          unprepared for whatever Nanang is going to do next.
          Nanang himself is entirely unprepared for whatever Nanang is going to do next.
          This is, somehow, the most dangerous thing about him.

        <h3>The Question This Chapter Must Answer</h3>
        <p>
          He is the party's variable, its renegade, its unaccountable constant.
          Something in him reaches toward the right answer through methods that the
          world has not yet developed categories for, and arrives somewhere adjacent
          to it with complete sincerity. The question his chapter must answer is whether
          that reach will, in the moment that matters most, finally connect with something
          that resembles intention. Whether it will be genius, or disaster, or some
          third thing that turns out to be both at the same time.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The enemy will certainly be watching. The party will definitely be standing
          slightly to the side.
