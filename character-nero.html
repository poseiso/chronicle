          <h3>The Nero Line and the Great Flood of the Cicau</h3>
          <p>
            The Nero family is Scottish by origin: or rather, the family line is, which by
            the twenty-first generation may have become more a matter of record than of
            lived geography. A line of half-elves who managed, across twenty-one iterations,
            to keep the same name and very little else consistent. Each Nero before him was
            born into the same general context, contributed a numeral to the name, and
            continued the tradition with the reliable loyalty of a family that has decided,
            collectively and across generations,
            that one name is sufficient. Nero XXI was born elsewhere, which was already
            irregular. He also did not stay there, which was not his choice.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            What removed him from the expected path was an event recorded in local accounts
            as the Great Flood of the Cicau: a mass movement of water hyacinth through the
            waterways, carried on by the particular decisiveness of a natural disaster with
            no interest in individual circumstances. Nero XXI, who was not secured, was
            carried with it. He drifted, by the record's account, through one country and
            then further, until he arrived in what the people there call home and those
            who observe from outside call the land of bamboo.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            It was there that he found the monastery. Or the monastery found him. Or he
            found the monastery and quietly removed several things from it before the two
            arrived at a more formal arrangement. The details differ depending on who is
            telling the story. Nero XXI has been asked for the accurate version. He has
            provided a version. Whether it is the accurate one has not been confirmed.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- The Twenty-First -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Twenty-First</h3>
        <p>
          Twenty Neros preceded him. He does not speak of them in great detail, which
          the party has come to understand is not indifference but something more like
          privacy: the lineage belongs to him; the specifics do not belong to anyone
          else unless he decides otherwise. What the family name carries is clear
          enough without explanation. Twenty iterations of a tradition produce a certain
          weight. He wears it lightly, which is how he wears everything, but it is there.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The monk's discipline came from the eastern monastery. The rogue's instincts
          came before that, from wherever the Nero line has always quietly learned to
          take what it needs. The two coexist in him with less tension than they should,
          which is perhaps the most Nero thing about him: he has made a working
          arrangement with his own contradictions, and he does not feel the need to explain it.
        </p>

      <!-- The Party's Economy -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Party's Economy</h3>
        <p>
          The party does not have a treasurer. What the party has is Nero, which produces
          the same outcome by different means. He manages the group's wealth the way he
          manages everything else: with complete control, total opacity, and results
          that are difficult to argue with even when you are not entirely sure how they
          were achieved.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          Anaik has, on more than one occasion, noted an item in a shop window and found
          it in his possession some hours later. He has not asked how it got there.
          Nero, when questioned about it by other party members, confirms nothing and
          denies nothing. The item is present. The situation is resolved. This is,
          in the Nero economy, a complete and satisfactory transaction, and both
          parties seem aware of this even if neither has said so directly.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He is also, it should be noted for the record, reliably the first member of
          the party to express displeasure when a battle concludes and the looting
          begins without appropriate organization. He has strong opinions on the subject.
          He articulates them. He does not articulate them on the occasions when he is
          the one doing the taking, during which time he becomes very quiet and very
          fast, and the party's collective inventory has grown by a measurable amount
          before anyone thinks to take stock.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- The Lightest Load -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Lightest Load</h3>
        <p>
          He carries less than anyone else in the party, by visible measure. His pack
          sits easy. He moves without the sound that even careful people make. When the
          party navigates a space that requires silence, Nero is already on the other
          side of it, waiting, having arrived by a route nobody else identified.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          What his inventory actually contains is a separate matter. It is fuller than
          it appears. It is consistently fuller than it was at the start of any given
          excursion. The arithmetic of how a man carrying so little ends each day
          holding so much is not the kind of arithmetic Nero invites inspection of,
          and the party, over time, has understood that some questions are most usefully
          left unasked.
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr class="divider" />

      <!-- The Double Word -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Double Word</h3>
        <p>
          He says things and means things, and the two are connected, but not always
          identical. The party has learned this. They have not learned to reliably tell
          the difference. He has, on documented occasion, told the exact truth in a way
          that functioned as a complete misdirection, and told something technically
          false that turned out, structurally, to point at something real. He does not
          mark which is which. He does not appear to feel this requires labeling.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          This is not malice. Or at least, it is not always malice. It is closer to
          habit: the particular habit of a man who has spent long enough moving through
          spaces he was not supposed to be in that honesty and strategy have become
          the same skill. He is the most cunning member of this party. He is also,
          when he chooses to be, the most direct. The party is still working out the
          conditions under which each version appears.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- How He Fights -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>How He Fights</h3>
        <p>
          He does not believe in fair fights. This is not a philosophical position;
          it is a practical one, arrived at through what appears to be a sincere and
          long-standing commitment to being alive when the encounter ends. When a
          battle turns against the party, Nero turns with it: he withdraws, finds a
          new angle, and returns from the direction the enemy was not watching,
          which is usually directly behind them. He is the lightest in the party.
          He is among the fastest. By the time the enemy has registered that
          something is happening at their back, it has already happened.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The monk's stillness and the rogue's opportunism have reached, somewhere
          inside him, a working arrangement that suits both. He does not explain this
          arrangement. He simply executes it, cleanly, from the angle of his choosing,
          without announcement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr class="divider" />

      <!-- Nero and Traxex -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>Nero and Traxex</h3>
        <p>
          His opinion of Traxex is not something he keeps to himself. He does not apply
          privacy to things he considers self-evident, and he considers his assessment
          of her to be in that category. She is reckless. She creates situations without
          thinking them through, departs the party's plans without notice, and then
          requires extraction from whatever she has walked into. This, in Nero's view,
          is not a character quirk. It is immaturity: the specific immaturity of
          someone who knows how to fight and has not bothered to learn how to think.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          He has said this. To her, not around her. More than once. She has returned
          it in kind, because Traxex does not absorb criticism quietly any more than
          she absorbs anything quietly. The animosity between them is mutual,
          consistent, and worn openly by both parties without apparent embarrassment.
          It does not prevent the machine from working. In the field, Nero's angles
          and Traxex's instincts are, despite everything, complementary. This is
          something neither of them has acknowledged out loud, and likely will not.

      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Question This Chapter Must Answer</h3>
        <p>
          He is the stealthiest, the most cunning, the one who holds the party's
          finances together with methods no one fully audits. He fights from the
          shadows, lies and tells the truth in equal and indistinguishable measure,
          and manages the group's economy with the quiet authority of someone who
          decided, without consultation, that this was his role and that no further
          discussion was necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The question his chapter must answer is not whether he is capable. He
          is demonstrably capable. The question is what he is capable for: what,
          underneath the economy and the misdirection and the twenty generations
          of inherited name, Nero XXI is actually working toward. Whether the
          party will find out, or whether it will remain his in the manner of
          all his best-kept things, is not yet known.
