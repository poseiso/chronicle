          <h3>First Impression</h3>
          <p>
            There is something clarifying about a man who announces his nature rather than
            waiting for you to discover it. Sogong Wahyudi said it plainly, without theater,
            in what was perhaps the second conversation any member of this party had with him:
            he is, by his own accounting, an evil person. He did not elaborate. He did not
            invite follow-up questions. He offered the information the way someone might
            mention the weather: relevant, apparently true, and not open to debate.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            He is also, without question, the largest member of this company. The party has
            since concluded that these two facts are probably related, though no one has asked
            directly how.

      <!-- The Self-Proclaimed Evil -->

        <h3>The Self-Proclaimed Evil</h3>
        <p>
          He is not performing. This is the first thing worth understanding about Sogong,
          and the thing easiest to misread. The appearance is not adopted for effect; the
          proclamation is not irony dressed as self-awareness. He looks the part because he
          is the part, or at least some version of it that he has settled into with the
          comfort of someone who stopped arguing with themselves a long time ago.
          Something in his history bent him in the direction he now faces.
          He has chosen to keep facing it.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          What that something was remains his own business. He has not shared it.
          He does not appear to intend to. The self-description stands alone, unsupported
          by context, which is either honest or deliberately incomplete, and the party
          has not yet determined which.

        <h3>The Shield That Remains</h3>
        <p>
          And yet.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          When a companion is in danger, Sogong does not calculate. The shield comes up.
          The Sanctuary goes out. It is not a policy; it is a reflex, and it is a paladin's
          reflex specifically: the one that persists after everything else about an oath has
          been discarded, broken, or simply grown too heavy to carry. He moves to cover
          his companions with the automatic certainty of someone who was built for exactly
          this and has not stopped being built for it, regardless of what he tells people
          about himself.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          The party has noticed. No one has said anything directly, because the kind of man
          who announces he is evil tends to be the kind of man you do not openly interrogate
          about the gap between his words and his actions. They have filed it away. They are
          watching. Beneath the bulk, the glower, and the self-assessment, something in
          Sogong Wahyudi is still standing guard. Whether he knows it, and whether he would
          admit it if he did, are two questions with answers he has not volunteered.
        </p>

      <!-- Anaik's Gamble -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>Anaik's Gamble</h3>
        <p>
          Anaik recruited him. This is worth examining, because Anaik's recruitment method
          consisted primarily of noticing that Sogong is very large and appears structurally
          resistant to a significant amount of incoming damage, and concluding that this was
          reason enough to bring him along. It was a purely pragmatic assessment, conducted
          with no particular interest in the finer details of personality, alignment,
          or stated self-identification as an evil person.
          Anaik has never expressed regret about this.
          Sogong has never expressed anything about it at all.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          What Anaik calculated: a body that could absorb what the rest of the party could not.
          What the party received: that, and something else they have not yet found the right
          word for.

      <!-- The Unknown Ledger -->

        <h3>The Unknown Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          His goals are his own. This is the cleanest way to state something the party has
          come to understand without anyone spelling it out. Sogong Wahyudi does not discuss
          his past with any apparent willingness. He does not explain his choices, his silences,
          or his continued presence in a company he joined under, from his side of the
          arrangement, entirely unclear terms.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          What motivates him? The evil-person explanation covers the surface and nothing
          beneath it. There is something underneath: there always is, with a man who wears
          his worst quality on the outside and keeps everything else locked behind it.
          Whether the party will learn what it is, whether it will come out on its own in
          some unguarded moment, or whether it will remain his until the moment it finally
          matters most, is uncertain. What is not uncertain is this: when the moment comes,
          he will be standing in front of them.

        <h3>The Question This Chapter Must Answer</h3>
        <p>
          He is the biggest, the most durable, and the most opaque member of this party.
          He calls himself evil. He raises his shield for the people beside him. Both things
          are true at the same time, and the space between them is where his story actually
          lives. The question his chapter must answer is not whether he will protect this
          party; he will, and that much is no longer in doubt. The question is why.
          And whether, when the answer finally surfaces, it will be something the party
          was prepared to carry.
