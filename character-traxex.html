          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            The ranger's trade is patience. Traxex did not receive that part of the education.
            Where others in her craft learn to wait, to watch, to read the wilderness before
            moving through it, Traxex learned only the second half: the moving. She is exceptional
            at it. She kills cleanly, efficiently, at range, from angles that should not be
            possible for someone who never stopped to calculate them. She is considerably less
            interested in whether she was supposed to be there at all.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
            Her skill is not in question. It has never been in question. What the party
            continues to negotiate with, in varying degrees of frustration and reluctant
            affection, is everything that comes attached to it.
          </p>

      <!-- The Killing Kind -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Killing Kind</h3>
        <p>
          There is a difference between a ranger who scouts and a ranger who hunts.
          Traxex is the latter, without apology and without much interest in defending
          the distinction. Scouting requires stillness; she has none. It asks you to be patient
          with information, to gather it quietly and return with something useful for people
          who will use it to make plans. Traxex is not a planner. She is a finisher.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          Her bow finds its mark because she does not hesitate between deciding to fire and
          firing; the two things happen at the same time, which is to say they happen
          instantly. In a party that contains a dragonborn of considerable strength, a paladin
          who radiates intent, a tiefling who moves like a rumor, and a sorcerer with access
          to the Weave itself, Traxex is still reliably the first to draw blood.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          She is also, reliably, the first to be bleeding. The same speed that makes her
          lethal makes her a target before anyone else has finished assessing the room.
          The fastest to kill; the fastest to die. She has accepted this arrangement
          with a pragmatism that the rest of the party finds less reassuring than she intends.
        </p>

      <!-- A Subplot All Her Own -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>A Subplot All Her Own</h3>
        <p>
          Give the party a town and they will explore it with some degree of purpose.
          They will talk to people, take on what needs taking, gather information,
          spend coin at the right establishments. Traxex will be somewhere else entirely.
          Not lost, not exactly. She has a talent for finding the one alley, the one
          tavern backroom, the one suspicious exchange happening in the wrong part of
          the market, and inserting herself into it before anyone has thought to say
          <em>wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          She does not plan to get into trouble. She moves toward motion the way water
          moves toward open ground: naturally, without deliberation, with complete
          indifference to where it leads. What she creates in these moments is less
          a distraction and more a second story running entirely parallel to the
          party's first one, complete with its own villains, its own stakes,
          and its own near-catastrophes. The party will find out eventually.
          They always do.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- The Party She Hasn't Claimed -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>The Party She Has Not Claimed</h3>
        <p>
          There is a question the party has stopped asking aloud, which is whether Traxex
          can handle herself. She usually can, up to a point. The more persistent question,
          the one that hangs over every <em>where is she</em> moment, is whether she will
          need them before she can reach that point. The answer, often enough to be a pattern,
          is yes.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          And when the answer is yes, they come. All of them. This is not something Traxex
          acknowledges directly; she would be visibly uncomfortable if anyone made it
          a point of discussion. But she knows. The party arriving in whatever alley or
          backroom or catastrophe she has stumbled into is not a surprise to her.
          It is simply what happens. She is theirs, even if she has not said so,
          and they are hers, even if she treats the fact like something she found
          rather than something she chose.
        </p>

      <!-- Nero and Traxex -->
      <div class="char-section">
        <h3>Nero and Traxex</h3>
        <p>
          Nero XXI does not hide his opinion of Traxex's habits. He considers her recklessness
          a form of immaturity: the inability of someone who clearly knows how to fight
          to learn how to think. He is not entirely wrong. He is also not entirely fair.
          What Nero reads as carelessness is, in Traxex, something closer to compulsion;
          she cannot stand still because standing still feels like disappearing,
          and she has no interest in disappearing on anyone else's schedule.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
          His frustration tends to land on her directly and with a sharpness she
          returns in kind. The animosity runs both ways and neither of them is
          especially subtle about it. It does not prevent them from functioning.
          In the field, Nero's discipline and Traxex's instinct are less opposed than they
          appear from the outside, and both of them are practical enough not to let
          a personal disagreement become the reason one of them does not come home.

        <h3>The Question This Chapter Must Answer</h3>
        <p>
          She is the fastest member of this party. That speed is her greatest quality
          and her most consistent liability, and there is no version of Traxex in which
          those two things come apart. The question her chapter must answer is simple
          and unkind: can she be fast enough to stay ahead of the consequences she
          creates for herself? Or will her bow strike true one final time in a fight
          she picked alone, in a room no one thought to look in, before anyone could come?
