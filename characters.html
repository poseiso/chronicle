            The lightest in the party. The fullest inventory.
            He tells the truth. He also lies. He manages the
            party's economy, fights from the shadows, and has
            very strong opinions about looting etiquette
            that apply to everyone except himself.

            A legend does not need a face. He chose iron over
            identity. Birch is in his blood regardless.
            He will watch a stranger do laundry with reverence,
            then remark that someone else needs to die,
            and Traxex will take that second part seriously.

            mankind. None of them land where intended.
            The enemy has no idea what he will do next.
            Neither does he. This is the point.

            is whether anyone will reach her in time.
