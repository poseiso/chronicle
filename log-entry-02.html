        <p class="drop-cap t-en">
          The day began slowly. This is the diplomatic version. The less diplomatic version is
          that Nero was awake at the appropriate hour, assessed the status of his companions,
          and found them collectively committed to the position that morning was a suggestion
          rather than a fact. Sogong was horizontal and very still, which with Sogong can mean
          anything. Traxex was present but showed no signs of intent. Anaik was on his back,
          examining the ceiling with the unhurried attention of someone who has scheduled this
          as a primary activity.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang was still asleep.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This distinction, between those who were awake and lying down and the one who was not
          awake, became, by collective agreement, the organizing axis of the morning. They decided
          that departure would occur when Nanang actually woke up. This was stated in the tone of
          people who have reached a resolution. Nero stated it in a different register, which was
          the first indication that the morning was going to move according to his schedule
          regardless.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">I. The Preparation, and What Nanang Did Not Receive</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero's suggestion was that they should go into town before departing. He said this with
          the brightness of someone presenting an idea he had already fully decided on. Some of
          the party understood immediately what he was implying. Others did not. Sogong, who
          understood, was already moving.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          What followed was a quiet and productive morning, as mornings sometimes are when certain
          people are applying themselves to specific tasks without making too much noise about it.
          Sogong initiated conversations with the relevant parties. He has a facility for this: he
          can give a person his full attention in a way that makes them feel the exchange is going
          somewhere of mutual benefit. Whether this reflects genuine interest or practiced technique
          is a question the chronicle is not positioned to resolve, and Sogong has not offered
          clarification.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          By the time the town portion of the morning concluded: Anaik had new armor. Sogong had
          new armor. Traxex had a new bow. Nero had an amulet and a ring, obtained by the method
          he prefers, which he did not describe and no one asked him to.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang, who was still asleep when all of this occurred, received nothing.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">II. The Spell, the Cow, and the Crab</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          He woke up eventually. The first thing he did was find Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He approached with the particular quality of movement of someone who has rehearsed a
          casual encounter and has not quite landed the casualness. He stopped in front of Anaik.
          He asked if Anaik wanted to see his new spell.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He had learned a new spell. Overnight. While the rest of the party had been occupied in
          town acquiring equipment and moving at the speed of people with a specific purpose,
          Nanang had been unconscious and had somehow returned to consciousness with new
          competencies. The mechanism by which this occurred was not raised. With Nanang, there
          are questions you do not pursue.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The spell was a charm: something designed to produce laughter in the target. He cast it
          at Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik did not laugh.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The precise reason is not something the record can determine with confidence. It may be
          that the architecture of Anaik's humor is structured differently enough from the spell's
          assumptions that the magic found nothing to grip. It may be that he simply did not find
          it funny. Either way, nothing happened. Anaik stood there. The spell arrived. His
          expression made no movement toward amusement.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang turned to Sogong. He cast the same spell. It landed; Sogong was, briefly, charmed.
          The charm produced no laughter because Sogong does not produce laughter easily, and a
          spell designed to extract something that is not immediately accessible will find the
          extraction difficult. The charm ran its course. Sogong looked at Nanang.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang turned to a nearby cow.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He cast the spell at the cow. The cow was charmed. The cow did not laugh. It stood in
          its field, charmed and unresponsive, contributing nothing to the experiment.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Having tested the spell on a black dragonborn, a paladin, and a cow, and having received
          the same result from each, Nanang arrived at frustration. He summoned the crab. The crab,
          which has become something of a fixture of this company's operational portfolio, appeared
          and immediately applied itself to Anaik. Specifically: to Anaik's person, with intent. The
          wound was deeper than the situation called for. Anaik looked down at it. The party
          observed this.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Everyone laughed. The chronicle records this without judgment: it was genuinely funny.
          The situation had earned the response.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">III. The Return of Nero, the Cape Dispute, and the Crow</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero came running. He was moving with the specific quality of speed belonging to someone
          exiting an operation that did not go all the way through. Some distance behind him, people
          with unresolved interest in the matter were following. Nanang, still standing in the
          street with his crab and an expression of academic calm, assessed the situation and
          deployed an intervention: the crab moved to intercept, occupying the pursuit with the
          same focused commitment it had recently applied to Anaik's arm. The pursuit slowed.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          In the recovery period that followed, Traxex raised the subject of the cape.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The heist had not gone all the way through, but it had produced one piece of
          intelligence: the location of a cape with specific properties, the kind that makes
          a person considerably harder to locate by anyone who might be looking. It was still
          there, unclaimed. The question of who it belonged to had not been resolved, which is
          how an argument about it became possible.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex wanted it. Nero's position was that he was the one who had found it, that
          he was the kind of person it was made for, and that both of these facts pointed
          in the same direction. Traxex's position was that she wanted it. The argument had
          the shape of something that was not going to be settled by logic, because only one
          side was using logic and the other side was Traxex wanting a cape.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The argument concluded. Nero offered to steal her a different one. Whether this was
          genuine generosity or the expression of someone who had already decided the cape was
          his and found it more efficient to resolve the objection than to continue the argument,
          is a distinction the chronicle does not feel equipped to adjudicate. The offer was
          accepted. The cape remained where it was, for now.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang, as the party was finally assembling itself to depart, summoned a crow.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He did this without announcement. The crow arrived, took the measure of the assembled
          company, and declined to be useful. It did not scout ahead. It did not carry information.
          It circled. It continued to circle as the party left the town. It circled along the road
          behind them. The party watched it. It circled some more. It was still circling when the
          road turned and the town was no longer visible: a small feathered question no one had
          asked, committed entirely to the shape of its own orbit.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          They arrived at the blighted village having already had a complete morning and now being
          asked to have an afternoon.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          A goblin was at the entrance. Sogong stepped forward. There was a moment where this
          could have been a conversation; Sogong is capable of conversations, the morning had
          demonstrated this. He appeared to decide against one. The party read the direction
          before the goblin had finished its first sentence. Nanang saw it coming and moved to
          intervene. He was too late.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The fight began.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          It was not the kind of fight with manageable dimensions. It had more participants than
          expected and better positioning than the party had time to assess. The enemy had grease.
          Barrels of it, placed and ready before the party had formed a response. The grease went
          down. It went under the party's feet and under the space where the party was committed
          to standing. Then the grease was ignited.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The explosion was thorough. The party absorbed it poorly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Almost everyone. Nero was not where the rest of the party had been. He had gone
          somewhere else before the exchange had a name, to the flank, positioned with the
          efficiency of someone who has simply never accepted the logic of standing in the
          middle of things.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">V. The Sequence of Falls</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          After the grease, the rest proceeded in the particular order of fights that have decided
          to take everything from you methodically.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang was first. He went down in the way he tends to go down: as a statement about
          the limits of cloth armor in a situation involving direct violence. Anaik brought him
          up. Nanang went to the back of the engagement, which in retrospect was the correct
          interpretation of the information the grease had provided. From the back line he
          summoned a spider and sent it to the roof, to the goblin archer positioned there, to
          deliver its venom. The spider arrived. It bit the goblin. The venom failed to hold.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang's expression communicated his assessment of this outcome clearly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex reached the edges of what she was able to absorb and stepped back. Anaik and
          Sogong held the front. Nero worked from the flank, cutting through numbers that were
          not quite decreasing fast enough. Then the goblin on the roof found Sogong. Sogong fell.
          The math stopped working.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik fell back. Nero fell back. Nanang died. Traxex ran.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">VI. The Roof, and What Nero Finished</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik did not run directly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He went around. He moved through the edges of the field, past the main line, through
          the part of the map that everyone else had already cleared out of, and came out behind.
          He reached the high ground where the goblin archers had been operating. He found one.
          He put his longsword into its back. It did not survive. Anaik has made a habit of this;
          it bears noting each time because a longsword backstab is not the conventional
          application of the weapon, and he continues to find the geometry for it anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The archers who remained found Anaik from their positions. They shot him. He fell.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This left Nero and Traxex. Traxex continued her commitment to survival through
          departure. Nero did not depart. He moved through the remaining enemies with the full
          inventory of available technique: every shadow, every angle, every approach the space
          allowed. The chronicle will not enumerate them. The result is the only relevant entry:
          the enemies were cleared. Sogong was revived. Nanang was revived.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik remained where he had fallen. The party was out of scrolls.
        </p>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">VII. After: The Basement, the Gnome, and the Question of Priorities</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          The party spread through the village in the way parties spread after a fight: individually,
          in different directions, toward different objectives, without coordinating first.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang found a basement. He began calling for the rest of the party to come look at the
          basement with the volume and persistence of someone who has found something significant
          and wants to ensure the group applies appropriate collective attention to it.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex found a gnome strapped to a windmill. She began calling for the rest of the party
          to come look at the gnome. She did this with equal volume and equal persistence.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Sogong was not standing around. He had moved through the village with the quiet
          efficiency of someone who has already decided what the aftermath of a fight is for,
          and what it is for is searching the premises. He found a wall that was not a wall.
          An illusory surface, concealing something behind it. He stood in front of it and
          said, with apparent feeling: "bro thought bro's Miyazaki."
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He said this more than once. He said it in the way of a person delivering a verdict
          that satisfies them deeply. The chronicle does not have a confident account of who
          Miyazaki is. The most probable interpretation, given the context of an illusory wall
          in a blighted and goblin-occupied village, is that Miyazaki is a figure of some note
          from the hells below, known perhaps for hidden passages and concealed architecture,
          and that finding his signature work here was either impressive or offensive to Sogong,
          possibly both. The chronicle records this interpretation with appropriate uncertainty
          and moves on.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero was calling about Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The result was the acoustic signature of a group that has survived something and is
          coping by raising the volume on its individual priorities. The basement case: Nanang.
          The gnome case: Traxex. The illusory wall case: Sogong, with evident personal
          investment. The case for the dead member of the party: Nero, with increasing
          specificity and decreasing patience. What was behind the illusory wall was not
          investigated. What was in the basement was not investigated. Anaik contributed
          nothing to anything.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero had enough. He went to town. He purchased the scroll. He returned. He used it.
          Anaik stood up.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Everyone was alive. The basement had not been investigated. The gnome remained strapped
          to its windmill. The illusory wall remained unexamined. The day was still long.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">VIII. Anaik's Calculus</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik was alive. The party had attended to this as a procedural matter immediately
          after other priorities. Nero had resolved it. The day continued.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          What the day continued into was the same debate that had been ongoing before the
          interruption of Anaik's temporary absence from the living: the basement, which Nanang
          held in strong regard, and the gnome, which Traxex had not let go of. The positions
          had not shifted in the interim. If anything, the fight had reinforced them, each party
          arriving at their preferred destination with the fresh conviction of people who have
          survived something and feel entitled to be heard about it.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik assessed the situation. He did this in the way he tends to approach logistical
          problems: practically, without sentiment, looking at what was in front of him rather
          than what he would prefer.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The basement was probably important. Nanang's instincts, for all the difficulty of
          predicting what those instincts would produce, had not yet led the party somewhere
          without content. The basement had merit.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The gnome also had merit, primarily in the sense that it was the one Traxex wanted.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The chronicle will reproduce Anaik's reasoning faithfully and without editorializing:
          any decision that went against Traxex would not end with the decision. It would continue
          into a proceeding. A sulk, an argument, a grievance entered into the ledger of the ongoing
          saga of Traxex's wants against the party's tendency to not immediately address them. This
          was not a position against Traxex; it was an accounting of her. Nanang, by contrast, had
          the capacity to revisit. He had declared the basement interesting; he had not, to anyone's
          knowledge, declared that it would be uninteresting at a later hour. The basement could wait.
          Traxex's willingness to accept waiting was a matter of record.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik told them they were going to the gnome.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He did not debate this. He said it with the volume a dragonborn has available when a
          dragonborn decides to use it, which is a volume that produces alignment through means
          other than argument. The party oriented toward the gnome. The basement remained where
          basements remain.

        <p class="t-en">
          The approach to the windmill revealed several things in sequence.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          First: the gnome. He was there, strapped to the arm of the windmill, visibly distressed
          and in evident need of assistance. The party took note of this. Their note had the quality
          of people noting something interesting rather than people noting an emergency; the gnome
          received the kind of attention applied to curiosities and objects of study, not the kind
          applied to someone who was going to fall off a windmill if steps were not taken. The
          chronicle records this observation and moves on.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Second: the goblins. A group of them, a couple of bugbears alongside, arrayed in the
          space between the party and the windmill. Less fortified than what the village entrance
          had offered. The archers had a rock formation, which gave them height, but the height
          was not dramatic, and the rest of the positioning was manageable for a party that was
          paying attention. Coming off the village entrance, manageable had required some recalibration
          as a word, but it applied here.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Third: where everyone was, which the chronicle is obliged to record.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex was on a nearby rooftop. This requires no elaboration; Traxex locates elevation
          and occupies it without needing to discuss the matter. Nero was already somewhere behind
          the windmill. The precise time at which he arrived there is not something the chronicle
          can establish with confidence. He is simply, sometimes, elsewhere before the party has
          finished arriving somewhere, and this is accepted as a feature of traveling with him.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The unconventional entries: both frontliners were in the enemy's backline. Sogong and
          Anaik, the two members of the party whose conventional assignment is to stand between
          the problem and everyone else, had apparently absorbed something from Nero's approach
          and applied it. Anaik was carrying his new greataxe, acquired from Nero through channels
          Nero had not described and Anaik had not asked about, because this is how equipment
          moves in this party and there is no alternative system anyone has proposed. The strategy
          was straightforward: Anaik would reach the archers on the high ground, and with the
          blood of Birch behind the swing, their prospects there were poor.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang had moved forward to open a conversation. He had prepared for this. He had cast
          the spells that lend a person weight and credibility, the kind of preparation that turns
          a sentence into an argument. The goblins were reading as neutral; neutral was the
          foundation Nanang was building on.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          What Nanang had not introduced into his calculation, or had chosen to set aside, was
          the scene behind his opening remarks: a full-armored dragonborn with a greataxe, and
          a paladin with his own intentions, moving quietly through the rear. The goblins shifted
          from neutral to hostile without a clear announcement, and in all honesty the chronicle
          cannot find this completely without explanation. Sogong offered the summary later, with
          the brevity of someone who considers the matter closed: "to be fair we were creeping
          up behind them."
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang spent some time furious about his spell slots.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">X. The Archer, the Sanctuary, and What Nanang Cast (Unclear)</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik opened on the archer.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The greataxe connected with the full commitment of someone who does not pause to consider
          whether a swing is proportionate to the situation, and with the additional physics supplied
          by Birch blood running through dragonborn arms. The archer on the rock formation received
          this without preparation and without sufficient defenses. What she had before the swing and
          what remained after it were two different categories of object; the second category also
          included a bow, which Anaik picked up while the fight was still actively ongoing around
          him. He has the carrying capacity other party members do not share, and the habit of acting
          on it at the first available moment regardless of what else is happening. Both of these
          things remained true.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Sogong moved to the nearest goblin and applied his mace with the precision of a smite.
          The goblin did not absorb this well. Then Sogong cast sanctuary on himself.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik registered this. There were goblins at multiple angles, a bugbear with unfinished
          business, and Sogong was not near any threshold that makes sanctuary the obvious call.
          Anaik filed the question in the category of things he did not have time to pursue
          and continued.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          From above, Traxex addressed the front line with the efficiency she brings when she
          has the position she wants, which is high, removed from the immediate problem, and
          looking down at it with a clear angle. The front of the goblin formation largely
          resolved itself under this arrangement.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang cast a spell.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The party noted it. The party was not certain what it was for. Something happened; the
          shape of what happened was not, in the middle of an ongoing fight, fully legible to
          anyone in a position to watch. The collective reconstruction afterward: "Nanang cast
          a spell, not sure what it's for." The chronicle accepts this as the record and does
          not press further.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero had found the windmill mechanism.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He engaged with it. The windmill stopped. The gnome, still attached to the arm, ceased
          its rotation. This was, considered narrowly, the favorable outcome; the fight was still
          ongoing around this development, but the objective was addressed. Nero's attention moved
          to the lever, which had further configurations he had not yet tested.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He tested them.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The windmill started again, faster than it had been moving before. The gnome contributed
          to this motion. Then the windmill stopped a second time. Then the gnome was no longer
          attached to the windmill; he was attached to a direction.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik was in the middle of the engagement and had no obvious mechanism for raising the
          matter without losing his thread. He said "anyone else seeing this" to no one in
          particular. No one in particular responded.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The fight concluded. The goblins were dead. What remained near the windmill was, using
          the most accurate language available: the quest, technically complete, and the gnome,
          not available for debrief. A laugh came from near the lever. Nero's account, offered
          through it: "I don't know, I don't know, I was just testing my thief skill on the lever."
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The chronicle considered this and arrived at the following reconstruction: Nero had not
          been attempting to save the gnome. He had been interested in the windmill. The gnome
          was attached to the windmill. These things connected in the way they connected, and the
          outcome followed from the connection.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero made his case that the quest was, in fact, finished. This was technically correct.
          The gnome had been separated from the windmill. The goblins were no longer a problem.
          Whether the separation met the parameters implied by the original framing is a judgment
          the chronicle declines to offer.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          No one argued at length. The silence had the particular quality of people who have seen
          what they saw and are still determining what category it belongs to. Anaik had an
          objection; the objection, to the chronicle's reading, was more concerned with the loss
          of a reward than the loss of the gnome, but even Anaik kept it brief. The morning had
          already been full.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          It was noon. The party moved on.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">XII. The Trouble With Following Traxex</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          The party had intended to rest. This was reasonable: the fight at the village entrance,
          the gnome, the lever, and the general shape of the morning had constituted more than one
          morning's worth of events. The intention lasted until it became apparent that Traxex was
          no longer anywhere near the windmill.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The party has experience with this. The options are: find her, or do not. The second
          generates the kind of problem that is shared only in retrospect and unpleasantly. The
          first generates the kind that is shared in the present, which is still a problem, but
          navigable. They moved north.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          They found a bridge. At the far end: an intersection. They did not turn left. To the
          right, dead bodies and the remains of a caravan. Around the wreck, a cluster of hyenas
          writhing on the ground, stomachs distended and visibly wrong.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero looked at them. "They're bloated," he said.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik said: "What kind of animal is bloated."
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This was delivered without the intonation of a question. Nero was disgruntled. The
          chronicle cannot determine, with available evidence, whether Anaik had not followed
          what Nero was pointing at, or had followed it perfectly and responded in that manner
          anyway. Both readings are consistent with what the chronicle knows of him.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex shot one of the hyenas. Without announcement. Without apparent deliberation.
          Anaik and Sogong read the situation and charged forward. Not a word had been exchanged
          about this. The party's unanimous and unspoken position was to kill the bloated hyenas
          in pain, and this decision had been reached by a method that involved no one actually
          reaching it.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">XIII. What Was Inside the Hyenas</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Before they could finish, it became clear why the hyenas' stomachs were as they were.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The gnolls that emerged were newborn and soaked in blood. They howled on arrival. From
          the hill above, more gnolls heard this and came down. Another fight was already happening
          before the party had finished deciding about the first one.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The chronicle notes the positioning: four members of the party on lower ground, with the
          hill and its occupants converging in front of them. Yes, four. Nero had already reached
          the top of the hill, behind the gnolls, by the time the rest of the party had registered
          the shape of the situation.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">XIV. Whirlwind</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik charged the newborns. They were grouped, he had the greataxe, and he announced
          his attack: "Whirlwind." What followed was, at best, a sweeping strike. The naming was
          an aspiration. The action was a large man swinging a large weapon through an arc and
          making contact; it accomplished what it needed to accomplish, which is its own kind of
          whirlwind if the definition is applied generously.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Sogong worked the newborns with his mace. Traxex offered support from the rear, if
          support is understood as the party member dealing the most damage while positioned at
          a comfortable remove from the problem. Nero worked the gnoll hunters on the hill with
          his daggers.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This last part did not hold. The previous fight had given Nero both flank and high
          ground; here it was a modest incline and gnolls with functional legs. Several from
          below redirected toward him. The frontliners were, again, deployed in a configuration
          that left the person most requiring their coverage without it.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Then Nanang summoned a frog.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          It arrived in the middle of the engagement, between Anaik and Sogong and the gnolls.
          The gnolls mauled it immediately. It had not been alive long enough to demonstrate
          whatever Nanang had intended; Nanang was furious about this; and the brief confusion
          of its appearance and death opened a gap that Anaik used to strike. The frog had
          served a purpose. It was not the one Nanang had planned.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Two gnolls broke from the main fight and ran toward Traxex. Anaik went after them.
          Sogong assessed the hill, saw Nero approaching the point that demands action, cast
          sanctuary on himself, and moved toward Nero.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          From further up the hill, the alpha came down: black-skinned, decorated in bones and
          skulls of animals the chronicle could not identify. It descended without hurry.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Sogong did not reach Nero in time. The alpha arrived first. Nero fell. The alpha
          turned its attention to Traxex.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex had noticed a puddle trailing downhill from the wrecked caravan. She fired an
          ice arrow at the two gnolls closing on her; the ice caught the puddle and spread along
          it and stopped both of them where they stood. She turned to the alpha. The arrow landed
          cleanly. The alpha went down at once.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The chronicle will not editorialize. It will note simply that this is why the party
          keeps her, and set aside the fact that the fight began because of her. Anaik breathed
          fire onto the frozen gnolls. The chronicle can only imagine what Traxex's expression
          looked like in response to this.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">XV. The Chronicle Does Not Believe in Greater Beings</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik ran uphill to assist Sogong. What remained below was left to Nanang and Traxex.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang, watching Anaik charge up the hill, said: "Finally I'm not being targeted and
          I won't be."
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The chronicle holds no belief in greater beings. If such things existed, they would
          have to be credited here; both gnoll hunters on the hill immediately turned and fired
          at Nanang, despite having Anaik and Sogong standing directly between them. Six arrows.
          He avoided five. He yelled "Sorry for being arrogant" while in the process of avoiding
          them, which is possibly the fastest acknowledgment of consequence this group has produced.
          The unfrozen gnoll charged him as well. Nanang cast the thick smoke he keeps for exactly
          this kind of moment, sealing himself and the gnoll inside it, blind to each other and
          to everything else. Including Nanang.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Uphill: Sogong cancelled his sanctuary and cast a heal on Anaik, returning him to full
          health. Anaik noticed that both gnoll hunters had eyes that glowed and moved with an
          erratic, unsettled quality. He registered this and moved on without following it further.
          An oversight.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The gnoll hunters opened fire on Sogong. Three shots in quick succession. Sogong is not
          nimble, and all three connected. He went down; not dead, but no longer a variable in the
          fight.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik killed the hyena in one swing. He now had two glowing-eyed gnoll hunters and no
          support.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Downhill, Nanang stepped out of the smoke and found himself facing the newborn gnoll
          at arm's length. A sorcerer at close range is a specific kind of problem for the
          sorcerer. He reached into his pack and produced a potion of sleep, which he threw at
          the gnoll from the shortest possible distance. It did not work. He cast minor illusion.
          That also did not work. He ran. The gnoll hit him as he went; his concentration broke;
          the smoke dissolved. Traxex put an arrow through the gnoll before it could follow.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The two frenzied hunters turned. One fired at Anaik: three shots, same cadence, same
          result. Anaik fell. The other turned to Nanang, and this time Nanang's footwork did
          not save him. He fell as well.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Everyone was bleeding out. Traxex ran.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Whether Traxex had finally shown her true colors: this is the question the moment invited.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          She had run to camp. At camp she found the lich the party had previously encountered
          in the crypt. She made the following arrangement: the lich would revive the full party;
          the price would be settled in gold. The lich agreed. Nero's chest at camp, which
          functions as a mobile treasury rather than personal luggage, covered the cost without
          difficulty.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          All of them stood up. They returned to the hill. Full health, full resources; the
          remaining gnolls encountered neither for long.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This is the party at a pinch: not operating by the expected method, not selected for
          virtue, not the chosen and not the pure. They find their way through by whatever rules
          are available to them, and they carry no embarrassment about this. The altercation
          ended the way it ended. They won.

          Anaik found an important-looking note in the wreck of the caravan and pointed it out.
          Nobody was interested. Anaik was also not interested; he had pointed it out, which was
          the necessary action, and the matter was complete.

          The lich's fee had been six hundred gold. Traxex had taken six hundred from Nero's
          chest, which she presented as exact payment for the exact price. The issue Nero had
          identified: Traxex had been carrying six hundred and forty-six gold of her own at the
          time of the negotiation. Nero performed the calculation and arrived at the figure of
          one hundred and thirty-six gold owed back to him. He wrote this down. He presented
          the paper to Traxex. She did not engage with it. He presented it again. He continued
          presenting it, with specificity and persistence, until Traxex returned the figure
          and the matter was closed.

          From the hill above came the sound of more gnolls, near the opening of a cave. The
          sensible reading was that the party needed rest before proceeding further. The party
          has occasionally operated on sensible readings. This did not appear to be one of
          those occasions.
