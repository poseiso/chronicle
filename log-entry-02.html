        <p class="drop-cap t-en">
          The day began slowly. This is the diplomatic version. The less diplomatic version is
          that Nero was awake at the appropriate hour, assessed the status of his companions,
          and found them collectively committed to the position that morning was a suggestion
          rather than a fact. Sogong was horizontal and very still, which with Sogong can mean
          anything. Traxex was present but showed no signs of intent. Anaik was on his back,
          examining the ceiling with the unhurried attention of someone who has scheduled this
          as a primary activity.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang was still asleep.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This distinction, between those who were awake and lying down and the one who was not
          awake, became, by collective agreement, the organizing axis of the morning. They decided
          that departure would occur when Nanang actually woke up. This was stated in the tone of
          people who have reached a resolution. Nero stated it in a different register, which was
          the first indication that the morning was going to move according to his schedule
          regardless.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">I. The Preparation, and What Nanang Did Not Receive</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero's suggestion was that they should go into town before departing. He said this with
          the brightness of someone presenting an idea he had already fully decided on. Some of
          the party understood immediately what he was implying. Others did not. Sogong, who
          understood, was already moving.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          What followed was a quiet and productive morning, as mornings sometimes are when certain
          people are applying themselves to specific tasks without making too much noise about it.
          Sogong initiated conversations with the relevant parties. He has a facility for this: he
          can give a person his full attention in a way that makes them feel the exchange is going
          somewhere of mutual benefit. Whether this reflects genuine interest or practiced technique
          is a question the chronicle is not positioned to resolve, and Sogong has not offered
          clarification.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          By the time the town portion of the morning concluded: Anaik had new armor. Sogong had
          new armor. Traxex had a new bow. Nero had an amulet and a ring, obtained by the method
          he prefers, which he did not describe and no one asked him to.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang, who was still asleep when all of this occurred, received nothing.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">II. The Spell, the Cow, and the Crab</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          He woke up eventually. The first thing he did was find Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He approached with the particular quality of movement of someone who has rehearsed a
          casual encounter and has not quite landed the casualness. He stopped in front of Anaik.
          He asked if Anaik wanted to see his new spell.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He had learned a new spell. Overnight. While the rest of the party had been occupied in
          town acquiring equipment and moving at the speed of people with a specific purpose,
          Nanang had been unconscious and had somehow returned to consciousness with new
          competencies. The mechanism by which this occurred was not raised. With Nanang, there
          are questions you do not pursue.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The spell was a charm: something designed to produce laughter in the target. He cast it
          at Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik did not laugh.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The precise reason is not something the record can determine with confidence. It may be
          that the architecture of Anaik's humor is structured differently enough from the spell's
          assumptions that the magic found nothing to grip. It may be that he simply did not find
          it funny. Either way, nothing happened. Anaik stood there. The spell arrived. His
          expression made no movement toward amusement.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang turned to Sogong. He cast the same spell. It landed; Sogong was, briefly, charmed.
          The charm produced no laughter because Sogong does not produce laughter easily, and a
          spell designed to extract something that is not immediately accessible will find the
          extraction difficult. The charm ran its course. Sogong looked at Nanang.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang turned to a nearby cow.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He cast the spell at the cow. The cow was charmed. The cow did not laugh. It stood in
          its field, charmed and unresponsive, contributing nothing to the experiment.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Having tested the spell on a black dragonborn, a paladin, and a cow, and having received
          the same result from each, Nanang arrived at frustration. He summoned the crab. The crab,
          which has become something of a fixture of this company's operational portfolio, appeared
          and immediately applied itself to Anaik. Specifically: to Anaik's person, with intent. The
          wound was deeper than the situation called for. Anaik looked down at it. The party
          observed this.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Everyone laughed. The chronicle records this without judgment: it was genuinely funny.
          The situation had earned the response.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">III. The Return of Nero, the Cape Dispute, and the Crow</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero came running. He was moving with the specific quality of speed belonging to someone
          exiting an operation that did not go all the way through. Some distance behind him, people
          with unresolved interest in the matter were following. Nanang, still standing in the
          street with his crab and an expression of academic calm, assessed the situation and
          deployed an intervention: the crab moved to intercept, occupying the pursuit with the
          same focused commitment it had recently applied to Anaik's arm. The pursuit slowed.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          In the recovery period that followed, Traxex raised the subject of the cape.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The heist had not gone all the way through, but it had produced one piece of
          intelligence: the location of a cape with specific properties, the kind that makes
          a person considerably harder to locate by anyone who might be looking. It was still
          there, unclaimed. The question of who it belonged to had not been resolved, which is
          how an argument about it became possible.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex wanted it. Nero's position was that he was the one who had found it, that
          he was the kind of person it was made for, and that both of these facts pointed
          in the same direction. Traxex's position was that she wanted it. The argument had
          the shape of something that was not going to be settled by logic, because only one
          side was using logic and the other side was Traxex wanting a cape.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The argument concluded. Nero offered to steal her a different one. Whether this was
          genuine generosity or the expression of someone who had already decided the cape was
          his and found it more efficient to resolve the objection than to continue the argument,
          is a distinction the chronicle does not feel equipped to adjudicate. The offer was
          accepted. The cape remained where it was, for now.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang, as the party was finally assembling itself to depart, summoned a crow.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He did this without announcement. The crow arrived, took the measure of the assembled
          company, and declined to be useful. It did not scout ahead. It did not carry information.
          It circled. It continued to circle as the party left the town. It circled along the road
          behind them. The party watched it. It circled some more. It was still circling when the
          road turned and the town was no longer visible: a small feathered question no one had
          asked, committed entirely to the shape of its own orbit.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          They arrived at the blighted village having already had a complete morning and now being
          asked to have an afternoon.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          A goblin was at the entrance. Sogong stepped forward. There was a moment where this
          could have been a conversation; Sogong is capable of conversations, the morning had
          demonstrated this. He appeared to decide against one. The party read the direction
          before the goblin had finished its first sentence. Nanang saw it coming and moved to
          intervene. He was too late.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The fight began.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          It was not the kind of fight with manageable dimensions. It had more participants than
          expected and better positioning than the party had time to assess. The enemy had grease.
          Barrels of it, placed and ready before the party had formed a response. The grease went
          down. It went under the party's feet and under the space where the party was committed
          to standing. Then the grease was ignited.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The explosion was thorough. The party absorbed it poorly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Almost everyone. Nero was not where the rest of the party had been. He had gone
          somewhere else before the exchange had a name, to the flank, positioned with the
          efficiency of someone who has simply never accepted the logic of standing in the
          middle of things.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">V. The Sequence of Falls</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          After the grease, the rest proceeded in the particular order of fights that have decided
          to take everything from you methodically.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang was first. He went down in the way he tends to go down: as a statement about
          the limits of cloth armor in a situation involving direct violence. Anaik brought him
          up. Nanang went to the back of the engagement, which in retrospect was the correct
          interpretation of the information the grease had provided. From the back line he
          summoned a spider and sent it to the roof, to the goblin archer positioned there, to
          deliver its venom. The spider arrived. It bit the goblin. The venom failed to hold.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang's expression communicated his assessment of this outcome clearly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex reached the edges of what she was able to absorb and stepped back. Anaik and
          Sogong held the front. Nero worked from the flank, cutting through numbers that were
          not quite decreasing fast enough. Then the goblin on the roof found Sogong. Sogong fell.
          The math stopped working.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik fell back. Nero fell back. Nanang died. Traxex ran.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦</div>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">VI. The Roof, and What Nero Finished</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik did not run directly.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          He went around. He moved through the edges of the field, past the main line, through
          the part of the map that everyone else had already cleared out of, and came out behind.
          He reached the high ground where the goblin archers had been operating. He found one.
          He put his longsword into its back. It did not survive. Anaik has made a habit of this;
          it bears noting each time because a longsword backstab is not the conventional
          application of the weapon, and he continues to find the geometry for it anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The archers who remained found Anaik from their positions. They shot him. He fell.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          This left Nero and Traxex. Traxex continued her commitment to survival through
          departure. Nero did not depart. He moved through the remaining enemies with the full
          inventory of available technique: every shadow, every angle, every approach the space
          allowed. The chronicle will not enumerate them. The result is the only relevant entry:
          the enemies were cleared. Sogong was revived. Nanang was revived.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Anaik remained where he had fallen. The party was out of scrolls.
        </p>

        <h3 class="t-en" style="text-align:center;font-family:var(--font-caps);font-size:1rem;letter-spacing:0.12em;color:var(--ink-faded);font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1.2rem;">VII. After: The Basement, the Gnome, and the Question of Priorities</h3>

        <p class="t-en">
          The party spread through the village in the way parties spread after a fight: individually,
          in different directions, toward different objectives, without coordinating first.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nanang found a basement. He began calling for the rest of the party to come look at the
          basement with the volume and persistence of someone who has found something significant
          and wants to ensure the group applies appropriate collective attention to it.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Traxex found a gnome strapped to a windmill. She began calling for the rest of the party
          to come look at the gnome. She did this with equal volume and equal persistence.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Sogong was standing in the same spot where the fight had left him. He remained there.
          What he was doing was not communicated.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero was calling about Anaik.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          The result was the acoustic signature of a group that has survived something and is
          coping by raising the volume on its individual priorities. The basement case: Nanang.
          The gnome case: Traxex. The case for the dead member of the party: Nero, with
          increasing specificity and decreasing patience. Sogong contributed nothing to any of
          these cases. Anaik contributed nothing to anything.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Nero had enough. He went to town. He purchased the scroll. He returned. He used it.
          Anaik stood up.
        </p>

        <p class="t-en">
          Everyone was alive. The basement had not been investigated. The gnome remained strapped
          to its windmill. The day was still long.
